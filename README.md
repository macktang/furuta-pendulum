# furuta-pendulum
Furuta Pendulum simulation in Python

This is a python simulation of a Furuta Pendulum.

The differential equations and state space representation were in the paper:
"Nonlinear stabilization control of Furuta pendulum only using angle position measurements"
by Lin  Zhao, Shuli Gong, Ancai Zhang, Lanmei Cong

The code started off from the example code found here:
