# furuta-pendulum
Furuta Pendulum simulation in Python

This is a python simulation of a Furuta Pendulum.

The differential equations and state space representation were in the paper:
"Nonlinear stabilization control of Furuta pendulum only using angle position measurements"
by Lin  Zhao, Shuli Gong, Ancai Zhang, Lanmei Cong

In the video, torque applied to the motor (blue) is equal to the angular velocity of the pendulum arm (orange).
