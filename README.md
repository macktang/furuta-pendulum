# furuta-pendulum
Furuta Pendulum simulation in Python

This is a python simulation of a Furuta Pendulum.

The differential equations and state space representation were in the paper:
"Nonlinear stabilization control of Furuta pendulum only using angle position measurements"
by Lin  Zhao, Shuli Gong, Ancai Zhang, Lanmei Cong

The code started off from the example code found here:
https://matplotlib.org/examples/animation/double_pendulum_animated.html

Video of simulation, using energy based controller to swing up (cannot balance yet):

In the video, torque is applied to the motor (blue) is equal to the angular velocity of the pendulum arm (orange).
